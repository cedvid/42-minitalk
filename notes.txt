NOTES:

Instructions

- exec names: client and server
- Libft: yes
- must be able to handle errors: no segfault, bus error, double free, etc
- no memory leaks
- one global variable allowed per program (server and client), use must be justified
- allowed functions:
◦ signal: set a signal handler for a single signal type
◦ sigemptyset: initializes empty signal set
◦ sigaddset: adds a signal to a signal set
◦ sigaction: examines/changes action taken by a process
◦ kill: sends a signal to a specified process
◦ getpid: gets the current process PID
◦ pause: suspends the process until a signal interrupts it
◦ sleep: suspends execution for seconds
◦ usleep: suspends execution for microsecond intervals
◦ exit: terminates the calling process

You must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.

• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
	
	PID: number used by OS kernel to identify an active process.
	May be used as parameter in function calls.
	New process is create by fork() system call and PID is returned to the parent process.

	getpid() -> to get the PID


• The client takes two parameters:
◦ The server PID.
◦ The string to send.

• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
Once the string has been received, the server must print it.

• The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think
it takes too long, then it is probably too long.

• Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without
needing to restart.

• The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using
UNIX signals.

	UNIX SIGNALS: standardized messages sent to a running program to trigger specific 
	behavior (eg quit or error handling). 

• You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
	SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are user-defined signals.
